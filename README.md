## Overview

[Create Portfolio](http://createportfol.io) is a guide that takes you through the process of getting a portfolio website up on the internet. It covers buying a domain name, setting up hosting, installing Wordpress and the uploading the Create Portfolio theme. It then moves on to how to add in and maintain all your content.

The accompanying WordPress theme is free, responsive and customisable. It's aimed at Art, Design, Illustration, Photography and Architecture students to get a portfolio website as cheap and easily as possible. A portfolio website can be an invaluable tool in getting a job – so here's your reason to not have one.
